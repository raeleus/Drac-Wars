You are wandering through a forest. Things are looking rather bleak for you ever since you lost the path an hour ago. You see a faint glimmer in distance. Deciding to follow its mesmerizing glow, you go to it.
It's a forest pixie! She buzzes around in an eccentric path and finally lands on your hand. She nuzzles your palm and rests her head on the lining of your glove. It seems she has befriended you. How cute!
You happen to know that forest pixies are nutritious and full of healthy vitamins.
